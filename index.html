    <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
        the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
        type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
        software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
